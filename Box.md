# Box

Learn to Box
One of the questions in the team meeting today was about using GitHub vs Box for meeting notes. 
@Maxwell.Rose thank you for taking the meeting notes, your teammates that could not make it appreciate it.

The answer is this: I prefer GitHub (simple and all in one place/searchable) but not everyone will have a GitHub account
and our repository is private so you cannot search/browse without an account. Box is for sharing outside our group and
especially with people that likely won't be in GitHub. In Box you can share for View/Download only. Also GitHub won't let
you edit Word/Excel so if that is your thing - Box. Box does have versioning for documents so it is possible to undo.
Large portion of the meeting was spent setting up Box accounts for everyone present, installing Box Drive and Box Tools
and explaining what the features of each tool are. @David was volunteered by me to make a FlipGrid video about this.
Another benefit of going through this - your documents in the cloud without having to move them around between laptops
or remember where things are. Also, Box has cool things like Link Expiration:

(this is Daily Challenge #30 now that I think about it - learn to Box). And this tool is really cool: https://rclone.org/box/.
And there is a Box CLI: https://developer.box.com/docs/box-cli and a Box SDK: https://developer.box.com/docs/sdks (OK, now I am done)
