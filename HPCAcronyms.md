# HPC Acronyms

Learn some common HPC acronyms used in COMSOL, ANSYS and other very common types of software that
can take advantage of HPC: FEA, CFD, CAD (and how they are related).

Finite element analysis (FEA) is a computerized method for predicting how a product reacts to real-world forces,
vibration, heat, fluid flow, and other physical effects. Finite element analysis shows whether a product will break,
wear out, or work the way it was designed. https://www.autodesk.com/solutions/finite-element-analysis

CFD (computational fluid dynamics) includes any numerical method used to solve fluid flow problems. FEA
(finite element analysis) is one numerical method for solving partial differential equations, independent of what the
equations are modeling. https://engineering.stackexchange.com/questions/14192/what-is-the-difference-between-fea-and-cfd

CAD or Computer-aided design is the use of computer systems to aid in the creation, modification, analysis, or
optimization of a design. CAD software is used to increase the productivity of the designer, improve the quality
of design, improve communications through documentation, and to create a database for manufacturing.
