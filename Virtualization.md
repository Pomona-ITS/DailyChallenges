# Virtualization

Why:

Now you might wonder what  virtualization has to do with High Performance Computing.
Or you don't even know what virtualization is yet. 
Well, guess what if you are on a Windows machine or even a Mac and you need access to Linux...
How do you get it? That's right, via a hypervisor that pretends to be a different computer... but it is right on your computer.

You can still do something called a dual-boot (google it) but that requires rebooting. This method allows you access to multiple
Operating Systems and what is even more important for a developer - multiple versions.


This is a practical hands-on thing that should make you feel like you did something useful 
even if you don't fully understand what and why yet.

Install a virtualization tool on your personal Mac (Windows).

Here is a fun article on [Oracle's VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) vs VMWare Workstation:

Just the installation should not take that long. 
*If your laptop is struggling with RAM or disk space, don't do it.

Some questions for the in-person discussion:

- Why VirtualBox? Are there other tools like this? Free?

- What about virtulization on Linux?

If you are too advanced for this move on to Vagrant.
