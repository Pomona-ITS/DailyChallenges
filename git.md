# git install (nothing more!)

Why:

You will be surprised at how many companies use version control and how many use git. I know I still am.

Install git (to start using version control).

On a Mac, you might have to install Homebrew - the Mac package manager (https://brew.sh).

You will need sudo, then do "brew install git." 

Alternatively, download and install a pkg file: https://git-scm.com/download/mac.

On a Windows machine, download a 64-bit exe: https://git-scm.com/download/win.

Alternatively if you don't have sudo privileges: create an account on GitHub and explore.
