# Command Line or CLI


If you are a Windows user and need access to command line these are your options (try one or try them all):  

* cmd for built-in Windows command line interface (somewhat limited to Windows-only stuff, most used commands are in Files and Folders section: 

* https://ss64.com/nt/commands.html), bonus points to those that know/learn what batch files are.  

* putty - a downloadable/installable and used for ssh'ing (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell) into remote Linux systems (https://putty.org/)  

* OpenSSH (https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/powershell/2017/12/15/using-the-openssh-beta-in-windows-10-fall-creators-update-and-windows-server-1709/) 
that can now be installed on Windows (both Server and Client)  

* PowerShell which is the Windows scripting environment (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/)  


* Cygwin (https://www.cygwin.com/)  


* XMing (http://www.straightrunning.com/XmingNotes/) which allow you to run X Windows applications (Linux GUI - Graphical User Interface).  
  
To run Windows apps on Linux you can use Wine (https://www.winehq.org/).  

On a Mac it is a Terminal (built-in) or iTerm2.  

On Linux it is known as a terminal as well. https://askubuntu.com/questions/38162/what-is-a-terminal-and-how-do-i-open-and-use-it
