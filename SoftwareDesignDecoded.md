# Software Design Decoded

From "Software Design Decoded, 66 Ways Experts Think"
by Marian Petre and Andre van der Hoek.


EXPERTS PREFER SIMPLE SOLUTIONS

Every design problem has multiple, if not infinite, ways
of solving it. Experts strongly prefer simpler solutions
over more complex ones, for they know that such
solutions are easier to understand and change in the
future. Simplicity is so important to them that they
often continue to search for simpler solutions even after
they have a solution in hand.
