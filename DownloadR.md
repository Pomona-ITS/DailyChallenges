# Download and install R and RStudio

Install R and RStudio on your local machine
R is command line and RStudio is an IDE; R can sometimes be faster than RStudio especially for larger datasets;
RStudio is a user's tool and can be used to develop and test concepts, R is scriptable and is typically run on HPC.

The language R is used by statisticians, data science and data analytics professionals. There is a raging debate
whether R competes with Python. In my experience, they are both useful and both have libraries and packages
that sometimes may work better, or be more developed than the other. There are also various bindings between
them to allow to run the existing code instead of re-writing. More here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDRa82lxzaU

P.S. We also support a web-based RStudio instance that is used in classrooms in mathematics, economics,
environmental science and other courses.
