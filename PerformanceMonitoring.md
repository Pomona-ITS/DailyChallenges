# Performance Monitoring

Performance Monitoring
On Mac and Linux explore “top”, “htop”, and “free”. All can be used to show RAM (memory) and CPU (cores) utilization. 
GPUs will have separate tools (for another Daily Challenge).

Windows has the Task Manager and perfmon and now Reliability Manager. For now it is enough to know that these 
exist and how to start them.
