# tmux

Install and use tmux - screen multiplexer/session/window manager
If you have access to a Linux VM (local or remote), install and use tmux - screen multiplexer/session/window manager. 
It has many purposes but one of the most useful is reconnecting to your (ssh) session even if a network 
connection drops without losing your output or killing a running process that you did not send to the background for some reason.

P.S. It does work on Macs as well but the primary purpose of this challenge is to teach you some healthy remote/HPC habits. 
P.P.S. You can also use "screen" but I personally like tmux better. For tmux vs screen, more here: 
https://opensource.com/poll/17/3/gnu-screen-or-tmux (TLDR: tmux is newer and has more features). 
Bonus points to those that also learn about/use/know ssh port forwarding/tunnels.
