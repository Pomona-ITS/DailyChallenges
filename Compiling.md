# Compiling

Compiling. Which happens in HPC. When you don't have an install-able package (or need the latest and greatest) but 
have access to the source code, say on GitHub.. you download the code (git clone...), unzip/un-archive the code,  
install a compiler if you don't have one already (and a whole bunch of dependencies), then do something 
like ./configure, make, make install (sometimes with a lot more arguments and changes to the configure/config file) 
and Ta Da, you have your binary file that is ready to be executed.
