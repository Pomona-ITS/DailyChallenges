Create an AWS account for yourself
If you haven't yet, create an AWS account for yourself. We will be exploring all 3 major cloud providers at some point but
for now just create an account so you are familiar with the process and I will post the summary of Re:Invent announcements
this week (there is a keynote every day and everything is streamed/recorded on Twitch if you also want to watch).
