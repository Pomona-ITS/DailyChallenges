# Job Schedulers

(JOB) SCHEDULERRRRS also called Workload Managers. (I know, finally). IF there is one thing  
about HPC that is uniquely HPC it is the schedulers. We use Slurm. To learn more about it go  
here: 

https://slurm.schedmd.com/tutorials.html.  
  
There will soon be more challenges where we make sense of various things that schedulers do,  
for now it is enough to know that such a thing exists and what it is called at Pomona and  
maybe what other schedules there are (most known: UGE/SGE also known as Grid Engine, PBS/Torque,  
LSF/OpenLava, Condor, MOAB).
