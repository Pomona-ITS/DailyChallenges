# Create a GitHub username if you don't have one


Preferably Pomona-email-related, but we do not currently have a policy on that. If you already have a personal account, 
that should be fine. Share your GitHub username in the HPC Classroom channel (or send it directly to Asya) so I can 
add you to the Pomona HPC repository with the documentation. If you have already done that, then you will be added 
to our test repo where we are going to practice working in version control as a team. 

When you are added to the test repo, I will give you the next challenge!

A coouple of words about why this might prove useful in the future:

- Lots of companies use git and GitHub and it is better for you to learn about it beforehand!

- You can use your public repo (repository) for showcasing programming and design work. Even technical writing if you like.

- Be careful with private information, for that you might want to use a private repo because they are not searchable/discoverable.

Or if you are simply not ready to share your work with the world yet. You can convert it or transfer the data to a public repo later.
