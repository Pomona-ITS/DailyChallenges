# Create a GitHub username if you don't have one


If you already have a personal account, that should be fine. 

A coouple of words about why this might prove useful in the future:

- Lots of companies use git and GitHub and it is better for you to learn about it beforehand!

- You can use your public repo (repository) for showcasing programming and design work. Even technical writing if you like.

- Be careful with private information, for that you might want to use a private repo because they are not searchable/discoverable.

Or if you are simply not ready to share your work with the world yet. You can convert it or transfer the data to a public repo later.
