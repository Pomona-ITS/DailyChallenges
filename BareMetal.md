# Wrap your head around Bare Metal and provisioning tools

Wrap your head around the concept of Bare Metal (which is the process of installing an operating system on a server) 
and Bare Metal Provisioning Tools. The cluster management utility (aka CMU) we use at Pomona is called Bright Computing. 
You can learn about it here:

In VMWare environment we use a hypervisor called ESXi. Here is the information on how that works (just reading 
it is fine, no need to reproduce):

In terms of Bright Computing, competition there is not much (HP acquired a French company, IBM's xcat is dead, 
Rocks is nearly dead, Intel has a proprietary tool). And finally, there are Cobbler (a veteran), OpenStack's Ironic, 
MaaS, Digital Rebar, Puppet/Razor, Packer/Ansible.
