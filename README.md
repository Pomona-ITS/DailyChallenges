# DailyChallenges

The Daily Challenges were created at Pomona College to establish a shared vocabulary for the student workers in HPC Support
and encourage them to explore and dicsuss the concepts that dominate our work lives.

[GitHub Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) was used to transfer the challenges from a Slack channel where they were posted over the course of a semester.
