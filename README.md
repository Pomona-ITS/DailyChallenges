# DailyChallenges

The Daily Challenges were created at [Pomona College ITS](https://www.pomona.edu/administration/its) to establish a shared vocabulary for the student workers in [HPC](http://hpc.pomona.edu/) Support
and encourage them to explore and dicsuss the concepts that dominate our work lives.

[GitHub Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) was used to transfer the challenges from a [Slack](https://slack.com/help/articles/115004071768-What-is-Slack-) channel where they were posted over the course of a semester.

There are  approximately (~) 50 challenges, they are not in any particular order but some of them do depend on others to have a deeper understanding of the topic.

They are not meant to be completed in full, you can pick those that speak to you more than others, but each ideally requires a discussion
to make sure you absorbed the information.

Most students get through 10-15 challanges in a week with a pretty good understanding of the vocabulary at the end of 4-5 sessions (weeks).
