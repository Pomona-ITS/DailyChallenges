# Arrays vs Lists

Has to do with our discussion about Arrays vs Lists in one of our team meetings. Mike had written this very
nifty comparison in C++. I am saving the .cpp file in GitHub and challenging you to figure out how to compile
it and run on your system. He did this on Windows. I saved his output, so you know what to expect on your
system. The results may vary. https://github.com/Pomona-ITS/hpc/tree/master/projects/ArraysVSLists
